### The Proposal

Will knew that Alison always had a special bond with her grandfather
Harry, who unfortunately passed before he ever had the chance to meet
him. In spite of not having him physically there, Will wanted to make
sure that Harry would be there in spirit when he asked Alison to marry
him.

With that in mind, the question was how? Harry was born in Brooklyn,
and fortunately for Will and Alison they always loved traveling to
New York City. Without her having any knowledge of what was
going to happen, Will and Alison booked a labor day trip up in the
big Apple.

So with a ring in hand and the vacation booked, the stage was set for 
the question to be popped. The first day of the vacation they spent
enjoying the wonderful bars and restaurants New York city has to
offer, with a nightcap going to see Hamilton on Broadway (don't ask
Alison about it - she fell asleep). The next morning Will and Alison
awoke and decided to take a trip across the Brooklyn Bridge. After
arriving in Brooklyn, they sat together on a short stone wall in
a Fort Greene Park. Birds were chirping in the background and
a Tai Chi group was meditation in the background. As they talked
and recanted the wonderful times they had spent together, and with
the spirit of Harry close nearby, Will finally asked Alison the all
important question of "Will you marry me?"
