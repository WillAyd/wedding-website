### The Big Move

After their time in Pacific Beach came to an end, the next living
situation took Will and Alison all the way across the country
to Will's parents' beach condo in Ocean City, MD. For many, the
concept of leaving San Diego to move to Ocean City would be foreign.
For Alison, this was a particularly new and exciting challenge as she
would be leaving behind the only home she ever knew.

In spite of the challenges, in July of 2023 Will and Alison packed up
the "Mazderatti" and hit the road for their cross country journey together.
Along the way they spent time in Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon and Denver.
After trekking the great nothingness that is Kansas, they made pit stops
at friends and family in Nashville, TN and Asheville, NC. Fun was had all around.
