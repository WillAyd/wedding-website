### Pacific Beach

After dating for a year the first big move in their relationship
came when Will asked Alison to join him in living in his Pacific
Beach apartment. Together they built their first home.

Will and Alison spent many a wonderful weekends going for bike
rides around Mission Bay, cruising around in the convertible
and enjoying walks on the beach. While sad their time there could
not last forever, it was an experience they will always share and
cherish with one another.
